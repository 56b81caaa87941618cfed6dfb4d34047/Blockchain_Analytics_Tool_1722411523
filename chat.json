Ethereum's blockchain consists of a distributed network of computers, called nodes, that run smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that automatically enforce the terms of an agreement between two parties without the need for intermediaries.\n\nOne unique feature of Ethereum is the ability to create custom tokens, also known as ERC-20 tokens, on top of the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens can represent assets, currencies, or other utilities. This functionality has led to the rise of decentralized applications (dApps) built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum also uses a cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) as its native currency. Ether is used as a reward for miners who validate transactions on the network and as a means of payment for executing smart contracts.\n\nOverall, Ethereum's blockchain technology has the potential to transform a variety of industries by providing a secure and decentralized platform for executing contracts and transactions.",
